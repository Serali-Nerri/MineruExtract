# CFST Extraction Rules V2.1

Use this file as the extraction source of truth for one paper.

Section map:

- `## 1. Target Scope`: decide whether the paper is usable at all.
- `## 2. Ordinary-CFST Gate`: decide whether a valid paper belongs in the ordinary dataset.
- `## 3-6`: apply schema shape, group mapping, paper-level fields, and specimen fields.
- `## 7-12`: apply evidence, loading, numeric, length, table-corruption, and invalid-output rules.

## 1. Target Scope

This workflow is for experimental CFST column papers that can support a unified ML/DL dataset for ultimate axial or eccentric compression resistance.

A paper is `is_valid=true` only when all are true:

- research object includes CFST columns or stub columns
- paper contains physical specimen test evidence
- paper includes usable specimen-level experimental capacity data
- loading mode is axial compression, single-direction eccentric compression, or a clearly separable mixture of those two modes

Grouped average measured capacities are still usable specimen-level experimental capacity data when the paper explicitly defines the repeated-specimen group membership, or gives enough specimen-count / parameter-set mapping to assign the same reported average to each member specimen row without fabricating group composition.
In that case, store the same `n_exp` on each member row, mark each affected specimen with `quality_flags += ["group_average_n_exp"]`, and make `source_evidence` plus `evidence.value_origin.n_exp` state clearly that the value is a group average rather than an individually measured row value.
If a paper reports only grouped averages but the member-to-row mapping is not defensibly recoverable, those loads are not usable specimen-level capacity data.

## 2. Ordinary-CFST Gate

The ordinary gate uses a two-tier, specimen-level evaluation model. Each specimen is individually tagged `is_ordinary=true` or `is_ordinary=false`. The paper-level `is_ordinary_cfst` is derived: `true` when the paper contains at least one ordinary specimen, `false` otherwise.

### 2.1 Tier 1 — Paper-Level Preconditions

These conditions apply to all specimens in the paper. If any fails, every specimen in the paper gets `is_ordinary=false` with the paper-level reason propagated to each specimen's `ordinary_exclusion_reasons`.

Tier 1 requires all of:

- `test_temperature = ambient`
- `loading_regime = static`
- no paper-wide durability conditioning (fire exposure, corrosion, freeze-thaw)

If Tier 1 fails, skip Tier 2 and set all specimens to `is_ordinary=false`.

### 2.2 Tier 2 — Per-Specimen Evaluation

When Tier 1 passes, evaluate each specimen individually. A specimen is `is_ordinary=true` only when all hold:

- `section_shape` is one of: circular, square, rectangular, round-ended
- `steel_type = carbon_steel`
- `concrete_type` is one of: normal, high-strength, recycled
- `loading_pattern = monotonic`
- compression mode is axial or single-direction eccentric
- no strengthening, no added confinement device, no stiffener that changes the basic member system
- recycled aggregate concrete has explicit `R%` recorded in `r_ratio`

Typical ordinary specimens:

- normal or high-strength concrete with carbon-steel tube
- recycled aggregate concrete with explicit `R%` and carbon-steel tube
- static monotonic axial or single-direction eccentric compression

### 2.3 Specimen Exclusion Tagging

When a specimen fails Tier 2, set `is_ordinary=false` and record each failing condition in `ordinary_exclusion_reasons`. Common reasons:

- `stainless_steel`
- `lightweight_concrete`
- `self_consolidating_concrete`
- `uhpc`
- `cyclic_loading`
- `repeated_loading`
- `non_ordinary_shape`
- `confinement_device`
- `strengthened_section`

A paper with mixed ordinary and non-ordinary specimens keeps all specimens in the output. Ordinary specimens get `is_ordinary=true`; non-ordinary specimens get `is_ordinary=false` with reasons.

### 2.4 Paper-Level Derivation

After all specimens are tagged:

- `is_ordinary_cfst = any(specimen.is_ordinary for specimen in all_specimens)`
- `ordinary_filter.include_in_dataset = is_ordinary_cfst`
- `ordinary_filter.ordinary_count` = count of specimens with `is_ordinary=true`
- `ordinary_filter.total_count` = total specimen count
- `ordinary_filter.special_factors`: list of paper-level special tags
- `ordinary_filter.exclusion_reasons`: list of paper-level exclusion summaries

## 3. Top-Level JSON Shape

Required top-level keys:

- `schema_version`
- `paper_id`
- `is_valid`
- `is_ordinary_cfst`
- `reason`
- `ordinary_filter`
- `ref_info`
- `paper_level`
- `Group_A`
- `Group_B`
- `Group_C`

Recommended `schema_version` value:

- `cfst-paper-extractor-v2.1`

Published `output/<paper_id>.json` files are the canonical dataset artifact. Any downstream tabular conversion is project-specific and outside this skill's canonical schema.

Use the schema description below as the worker's example source of truth. Do not inspect `runs/`, prior outputs, or unrelated papers to infer JSON shape.

## 4. Group Mapping

- `Group_A`: square / rectangular
  - `b`: outer width
  - `h`: outer depth
- `Group_B`: circular
  - `b = h = D`
  - `r0 = h / 2`
- `Group_C`: elliptical / round-ended / obround
  - `b`: major axis
  - `h`: minor axis
  - `b >= h`
  - `r0 = h / 2`

Unlike v1, `Group_A.r0` is not forced to zero. Keep a nonzero corner radius when the paper provides it or when the section is clearly rounded-corner rectangular.

## 5. Required Paper-Level Fields

### 6.2 Field Semantics

- `ref_no`: fixed empty string `""`
- `specimen_label`: unique, non-empty specimen ID
- `boundary_condition`: trace metadata for the specimen support/end condition; may be `null` or `unknown`
- `fc_value`: source concrete strength value in MPa
- `fc_type`: source concrete specimen description, for example `Cube 150`, `Cylinder 100x200`, or `Prism 150x150x300`
- `fc_basis`: basis category of `fc_value`; use `prism` for prism / axial-compression concrete-strength systems, not for CFST member loading mode

`fc_value` and `fc_type` must describe the same source measurement. If the paper reports a strength of 45.0 MPa measured on a 100 mm cube, store `fc_type = "Cube 100"` and `fc_value = 45.0`. If the paper has already converted that value to a 150 mm standard cube equivalent and states 42.75 MPa, store `fc_type = "Cube 150"` and `fc_value = 42.75`. Never pair an `fc_value` from one specimen basis with an `fc_type` from another.
Do not store shorthand notation or explanatory prose in `fc_type`. Values such as `fck`, `fcu`, `f'c`, `fc`, or `Prism-equivalent fck converted from Cube 150` are invalid `fc_type` strings. Put notation/basis explanation in `fc_basis`, `source_evidence`, and `evidence.value_origin` instead.
In Chinese GB/T 50010-type context, if the nearby grade notation and the reported measured strength clearly indicate the standard-cube system, store a cube-form `fc_type` consistent with that measured value even when the local symbol usage is sloppy. Record the notation mismatch in `source_evidence` and `evidence.value_origin.fc_value`, not in `fc_type`.

Concrete examples:

- source says `150 mm cube = 45.0 MPa`:
  `fc_basis = cube`, `fc_type = Cube 150`
- source says `100x200 cylinder = 60.0 MPa`:
  `fc_basis = cylinder`, `fc_type = Cylinder 100x200`
- in Chinese GB/T 50010 context, the stored value is `fck = 53.4 MPa` and the paper makes clear this is an axial/prism-system strength:
  `fc_basis = prism`, `fc_type = Prism`
  put the `fcu -> fck` or code-context explanation in `source_evidence` and `evidence.value_origin.fc_value`
- in Chinese GB/T 50010 context, the paper states the concrete was proportioned to `C30` and reports a measured compressive strength of `30.5 MPa`; the local grade context and value magnitude align with the standard-cube system rather than the GB/T prism/axial meaning of `fck`:
  `fc_basis = cube`, `fc_type = Cube 150`
  explain in `source_evidence` and `evidence.value_origin.fc_value` that the stored value is treated as a measured cube-strength value under the nearby `C30` grade context; if the paper locally labels that value with `fck`, record that notation issue in evidence rather than mirroring it in `fc_type`
- basis cannot be resolved defensibly:
  `fc_basis = unknown`, `fc_type = Unknown`

Invalid examples:

- `fc_type = fck`
- `fc_type = Prism-equivalent fck converted from Cube 150`

- `fy`: steel yield strength in MPa
- `fcy150`: normalized 150 mm cylinder compressive strength in MPa; keep the key present, but `null` is allowed during extraction when project-level conversion is deferred
- `r_ratio`: recycled aggregate ratio in percent, use `0` for normal concrete
- `b`, `h`, `t`, `r0`, `L`, `e1`, `e2`: numbers stored in mm
- `L`: project geometric specimen length in mm; do not reinterpret it as effective length
- `n_exp`: experimental ultimate load in kN
- when `n_exp` comes from an explicitly reported group average for repeated specimens, assign that same average to each defensibly identified member row and mark `quality_flags += ["group_average_n_exp"]`
- `source_evidence`: concise human-readable trace string
- `loading_pattern`: the loading pattern for this specific specimen (`monotonic`, `cyclic`, `repeated`, or `unknown`); when the paper uses a single loading pattern for all specimens, every specimen receives the same value; when the paper mixes patterns, each specimen records its own
- `is_ordinary`: boolean indicating whether this specimen qualifies for the ordinary CFST dataset; derived from the two-tier evaluation in §2
- `ordinary_exclusion_reasons`: list of strings identifying why the specimen is non-ordinary; must be empty when `is_ordinary=true`; must be non-empty when `is_ordinary=false`
- `quality_flags`: list of extraction-risk flags such as `group_average_n_exp`, `derived_L`, `unit_converted`, `context_inferred_fc_basis`

For recycled aggregate concrete, `r_ratio` must record the recycled aggregate replacement ratio `R%`.

### 6.2.1 Concrete-Strength Basis Resolution

Resolve `fc_basis` using the following priority order:

1. explicit statements in `Materials`, `Specimens`, `Concrete properties`, notation sections, specimen tables, and table footnotes
2. explicit specimen/test descriptions such as `150 mm cube`, `100x200 cylinder`, `ASTM C39 cylinder`, `JIS A 1108`, `JIS A 1132`, or prism / axial-compression concrete-strength wording
3. cited design-code or test-standard context, including code-defined grade notation such as Chinese GB/T 50010 `C30` / `C40` / `C50` / `C60` and Eurocode / EN 206 `C60/75`
4. shorthand strength symbols such as `f'c`, `Fc`, `fck`, `fc`, or bare notation whose governing code context is still unresolved

Apply these rules:

- before relying on symbols such as `fck`, `fc`, `f'c`, or `Fc`, first search the same sentence, paragraph, table header, and table footnote for nearby concrete-strength-grade signals such as `C30`, `C40`, `C50`, `C60`, or `C60/75`
- if the source explicitly says `cube`, `150 mm cube`, or equivalent standard cube wording, use `fc_basis = cube`
- if the source explicitly says `cylinder`, gives cylinder dimensions, or cites cylinder-based test standards, use `fc_basis = cylinder`
- if the source explicitly says prism strength, axial compressive strength, or uses the Chinese GB/T 50010 `fck` / `fc` axial-compression system, use `fc_basis = prism`
- treat explicit material/test descriptions as higher priority than shorthand grades in titles, abstracts, or specimen labels
- in Chinese GB/T 50010-type context, a nearby single-grade `C30` / `C40` / `C50` / `C60`-style notation is a code-defined cube-strength cue at the design-code layer and must be checked before a nearby bare `fck` / `fc` symbol is allowed to lock `fc_basis = prism`
- in the same Chinese GB/T 50010-type context, when a reported measured strength value is numerically consistent with the nearby cube-grade system and clearly inconsistent with the prism/axial reading of a nearby `fck` / `fc` symbol, you may resolve `fc_basis = cube`; explain the local notation mismatch explicitly in `source_evidence` and `evidence.value_origin.fc_value`
- when both cube and cylinder strengths are reported, store the basis/value that the paper explicitly uses in material parameters, constitutive calculations, or specimen-property tables; cite that decision in `source_evidence`

Country/context rules:

- China / GB/T 50010 context:
  - bare `C30`, `C40`, `C50`, `C60`, `C70`, and similar `C` grades are code-defined concrete strength grades in the 150 mm standard cube-strength system
  - these Chinese `Cxx` grades belong to the code-context layer and outrank nearby bare `fck` / `fc` symbol usage when the two conflict
  - `fck` and `fc` are axial/prism-system values in this context, not cylinder strengths
- Europe / EN 206 / Eurocode context:
  - `Cx/y` means `x = characteristic cylinder strength`, `y = cube strength`
  - `Cx/y` is a code-defined grade pair and belongs to the code-context layer, not the bare-symbol fallback layer
  - a bare single-value `C60` in a European paper is shorthand and remains ambiguous until the paper confirms which basis is being used
  - `fck` in Eurocode is the characteristic cylinder compressive strength; when a European paper writes `fck = 60 MPa` without a `Cx/y` grade, treat it as `fc_basis = cylinder`
- United States / ACI / ASTM C39 context:
  - `f'c` is cylinder-based specified compressive strength
  - a bare `C60` is not enough by itself to justify `cube` or `cylinder`
- Japan / `Fc` / JIS A 1108 / JIS A 1132 context:
  - `Fc` is normally tied to the Japanese cylinder-based concrete-strength system
  - a bare `C60` is not enough by itself to justify `cube` or `cylinder`

Cross-code symbol disambiguation:

The same symbol can carry completely different meanings across national codes. Do not interpret a symbol by its letters alone; always check which code system the paper is operating in.

- China `fck` is NOT Eurocode `fck`. In GB/T 50010, `fck` is the characteristic axial/prism compressive strength converted from the cube grade (e.g., C60 → fck = 38.5 MPa). In Eurocode, `fck` is the characteristic cylinder compressive strength (e.g., C60/75 → fck = 60 MPa).
- China `fc` is NOT US `f'c`. In GB/T 50010, `fc` is the axial compressive design value (lower than fck). In ACI, `f'c` is the specified compressive strength defaulting to cylinder tests.
- Japan `Fc` is a separate notation. It is the Japanese design standard strength tied to cylinder-based JIS testing, not interchangeable with Chinese `fc` or US `f'c`.

When a paper cites multiple national codes or compares specimens across code systems, resolve each specimen's `fc_basis` against the code that governs that specific specimen, not against a single assumed code for the whole paper.

Ambiguity rules:

- do not infer `cube` from a bare `C60`-style notation unless the paper is clearly operating in a Chinese GB/T 50010-type context or explicitly says cube
- do not infer `cylinder` from a bare `C60`-style notation unless the paper explicitly ties that notation to cylinder-based testing or code context
- if a nearby `Cxx` grade signal and a nearby `fck` / `fc` symbol point to different bases, and no explicit cube / cylinder / prism test description resolves the conflict, do not force the symbol-based basis; in Chinese GB/T 50010-type context, if the nearby grade context plus the reported measured value clearly support the cube-strength system, you may resolve `fc_basis = cube`; otherwise set `fc_basis = unknown`
- if the basis remains unresolved after checking the paper text, cited standards, and table notes, set `fc_basis = unknown`
- when `fc_basis = unknown`, keep `fcy150 = null` unless the paper itself provides a defensible normalized cylinder value
- for context-inferred decisions, make `source_evidence` cite the specific section/table/note and the standard or notation that justified the choice

### 6.3 Canonical Units

Store numeric values in the published JSON using these canonical units:

- `fc_value`, `fy`, `fcy150`: `MPa`
- `r_ratio`: `%`
- `b`, `h`, `t`, `r0`, `L`, `e1`, `e2`: `mm`
- `n_exp`: `kN`

## 7. Evidence Contract

Each specimen `evidence` object must contain:

- `page`
- `table_id`
- `figure_id`
- `table_image`
- `setup_image`
- `value_origin`

`evidence.page` is required and should always be populated since the worker knows which PDF page it read. When page localization is defensibly recoverable, `source_evidence` should also state it explicitly with wording such as `Page 4 Table 1`.
If page localization still cannot be determined, set `evidence.page = null` and keep the best available table/figure/text locator in `source_evidence` rather than inventing a page number.

`evidence.table_image` may be `null` when the paper is read directly from PDF. The page reference in `evidence.page` serves as the locator for the specimen-bearing table.

`evidence.setup_image` may be `null`. The page reference goes in `evidence.page` or `paper_level.setup_figure.page`.

`value_origin` is a dictionary keyed by field name. Each populated field entry should contain:

- `kind`: `direct`, `derived`, `normalized`, or `recovered_from_image`
- `raw_text`
- `raw_unit`
- `formula`
- `source`

When a stored value is converted to canonical units or normalized from another basis, preserve the original text/unit in `value_origin` and mark the step with `kind = normalized` or `quality_flags += ["unit_converted"]` as appropriate.

### 7.1 Reducing Redundancy in `value_origin`

When multiple specimens share identical evidence for a field (e.g., all specimens use the same concrete strength from a single material properties section), you may use a **reference shorthand** to reduce JSON size:

**Option 1: Omit fully redundant entries**
- For fields where **all specimens** share identical `value_origin` (same `raw_text`, `raw_unit`, `formula`, `source`), you may omit the `value_origin` entry from individual specimens and document the shared evidence once in `paper_level.notes`.
- Example: If all 12 specimens use `fc_value` from "Page 4 Section 2.3: C30 concrete, measured fck=30.5 MPa", include this in `paper_level.notes` and omit `fc_value` from each specimen's `value_origin`.
- **Critical**: Only omit when the evidence is **truly identical** across all specimens. If even one specimen differs, include full `value_origin` for all.

**Option 2: Minimal row-specific entries**
- For fields extracted from a specimen table where only the row identifier changes (e.g., `fy`, `b`, `h`, `t`, `L`, `n_exp` from "Table 1 row SC-1" → "Table 1 row SC-2" → ...), you may use a shortened form:
  ```json
  "fy": {
    "kind": "direct",
    "raw_text": "342",
    "raw_unit": "MPa",
    "source": "Table 1"
  }
  ```
  Instead of the full form with `"source": "Page 3 Table 1 row SC-1"`. The row identifier is already implicit in `specimen_label`.

**Option 3: Shared evidence in `paper_level`**
- Add an optional `paper_level.shared_evidence` object to store evidence that applies to all specimens:
  ```json
  "paper_level": {
    "shared_evidence": {
      "fc_value": {
        "kind": "direct",
        "raw_text": "核心混凝土强度等级按C30进行配制，最后测得fck=30.5 MPa",
        "raw_unit": "MPa",
        "source": "Page 4 Section 2.3"
      },
      "e1": {"kind": "derived", "raw_text": "12根钢管混凝土轴压短柱", "raw_unit": "mm", "formula": "0", "source": "Page 1 abstract"},
      "e2": {"kind": "derived", "raw_text": "12根钢管混凝土轴压短柱", "raw_unit": "mm", "formula": "0", "source": "Page 1 abstract"}
    }
  }
  ```
  Then omit these fields from individual specimen `value_origin` objects.

**Default behavior**: If you are unsure whether evidence is truly shared or if simplification might lose traceability, **keep the full `value_origin` for every specimen**. Redundancy is acceptable; loss of provenance is not.

Example:

```json
{
  "value_origin": {
    "L": {
      "kind": "derived",
      "raw_text": "L = 3D",
      "raw_unit": "mm",
      "formula": "3 * 141.4",
      "source": "Page 4, Fig. 1"
    }
  }

## 8. Loading-Mode Rules

- determine paper-level loading mode from setup-figure evidence when available
- preserve specimen-level loading mode in every row
- if specimen `loading_mode = axial`, enforce `e1 = 0` and `e2 = 0`
- if specimen `loading_mode = eccentric`, at least one of `e1`, `e2` must be nonzero
- preserve the original signs of `e1` and `e2`
- `e1` and `e2` may have the same sign or opposite signs; sign alone must not be used to exclude an otherwise ordinary specimen
- mixed papers must still store each specimen row with its own loading mode

## 9. Numerical Rules

- use `scripts/safe_calc.py` for every conversion and derived value
- convert stored values to the canonical units defined above before writing JSON
- round numeric outputs to `0.001`
- enforce:
  - `fc_value > 0`
  - `fy > 0`
  - `fcy150 > 0` when `fcy150` is populated
  - `b > 0`
  - `h > 0`
  - `t > 0`
  - `L > 0`
  - `n_exp > 0`
  - `0 <= r_ratio <= 100`
- `t` must be strictly smaller than `min(b, h) / 2`
- keep `fcy150 = null` when the project defers strength-basis conversion; do not fabricate it during extraction

A specimen with `is_ordinary=true` must satisfy all of:

- `section_shape in {square, rectangular, circular, round-ended}`
- `steel_type = carbon_steel`
- `concrete_type in {normal, high_strength, recycled}`
- `loading_pattern = monotonic`

Paper-level Tier 1 preconditions (checked once, applied to all specimens):

- `test_temperature = ambient`
- `loading_regime = static`

## 10. Length Rule

Determine `L` as the project geometric specimen length with this priority:

1. explicit specimen length in paper text/table/note
2. explicit formula or ratio with clear variable meaning
3. figure-based derivation with explicit geometry evidence, including steel-tube net height when the figure makes that geometry unambiguous

If the paper does not name `L` directly but the specimen/setup figure makes the steel-tube net height derivable, use that geometric length and record the basis in `source_evidence` and `evidence.value_origin.L`.

Do not populate `L` when the geometry basis is ambiguous. Do not infer `L` from boundary-condition assumptions or effective-length formulas.

## 11. Direct PDF Reading

The worker reads the paper through the `pdf_pages` MCP tool. Each PDF page is rendered as a high-resolution image. The page image is the single source of truth for all specimen values including row boundaries, merged cells, units, symbols, and signs.

Do not extract specimen values from any text layer or OCR output. Read values directly from the rendered PDF page images.

## 12. Invalid And Failed Outputs

### 12.1 Invalid Paper

If paper is outside the experimental CFST-column scope:

- `is_valid=false`
- `is_ordinary_cfst=false`
- `ordinary_filter.include_in_dataset=false`
- `ref_info` may still contain bibliographic metadata when available
- `Group_A=[]`, `Group_B=[]`, `Group_C=[]`

### 12.2 Processing Failure

When evidence is insufficient for a defensible extraction:

- stop with a clear failure reason
- do not fabricate row values
- keep intermediate output outside final published output
